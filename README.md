# Interactive-Calculator
An interactive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations through a graphical interface.
HTML:
The HTML structure includes the calculatorâ€™s display screen and buttons for digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=). Each button is wrapped in a form or div container to maintain the layout.

CSS:
CSS styles the calculator, providing visual appeal and usability. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, button sizes, and hover effects, ensuring that the calculator is user-friendly and visually coherent.

JavaScript:

JavaScript handles the functionality of the calculator. It captures user inputs from button clicks, updates the display screen, performs arithmetic calculations, and handles special functions like clearing the screen or computing the result. Event listeners are used to detect button clicks and execute the corresponding operations.
